A small (Small as 8KB!) library for performing your AJAX tasks, if you only need AJAX into your site, this library does it pretty well, and its very straight forward. We are currently using it at my job, and it does fine :).The library itself is all 100% Object Oriented javascript, and it doesnt uses eval at any time (like some do). If youre coming from PHP and have no idea about AJAX, this is a nice choice to use!
